    Main function to output a FITS catalog with calibrations and weights, given some input catalog
    based on the LSST Science Pipelines image processing routines.

    Usage: The routine is run as follows:

        python gen_hsc_calibrations.py input_file output_file_name

    It will read in the input file (`input_file`) in FITS format, and produce an output FITS file
    named `output_file_name` with the new information.

    Dependencies: To run this script, you will need to have installed astropy and numpy.

    Memory usage: The script will ingest the data into memory, and make some additional columns, so
    the memory usage can range from 1-2x the size of the ingested catalog.
